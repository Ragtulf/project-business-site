# Business Site ðŸ‘”

This is a website made in the Technigo Bootcamp - Spring 2020.

My business site is a signup form to get a subscription of a magazine.

## How I did it

The project was to focus on forms and input methods, a FAQ accordion and a hero-banner for a header. 

Responsiveness is very important to me and I want to get better at it so that is what I focused on as well. 

I used flexbox, some beginner javascript and spent a long time on getting icons to turn when the accordion expanded.
