# Business Site

My business site is a signup form to get a subscription of a magazine.

## The problem

I spent more time now sketching the website before beginning and that really helped. 
I used flexbox, media queries and learned how to use a background image as a header.
If I had more time I would spend it trying to figure out how to style the form so it looks nicer if something is filled out in the wrong way. 
I also would style the checkbox. I don't understand why I could style the radio inputs but the checkbox was so much harder.
